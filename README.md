Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis
• Built a machine learning pipeline to predict customer satisfaction based on flight experience data (e.g., service quality, delays, travel class).
• Trained and compared multiple models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest) using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
• Developed an interactive Flask-based web app with charts (bar graphs, evaluation metrics) to visualize model performance.
